# Kruskal's Algorithm Simulator
We are designing an interactive web-based tool that visually demonstrates Kruskal's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in a graph. This project was developed as an educational resource to help students and developers understand graph algorithms through visualization.

## Features

- **Interactive Graph Creation**: Place vertices and add weighted edges
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Watch how Kruskal's algorithm builds the MST
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - Highlighted edges being considered
  - MST edges shown in distinct color
  - Cycle detection visualization
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and tablet devices
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between color themes
- **Edge Management**: Add, remove, and view all edges in a table
- **MST Cost Calculation**: Automatically calculates and displays the total weight of the MST

## How to Use

1. Set the number of vertices and click "Place Vertices"
2. Click on the canvas to position your vertices
3. Add edges between vertices by specifying source, destination, and weight
4. Click "Run Algorithm" to visualize Kruskal's algorithm
5. Watch as edges are considered and added to the MST
6. View the final MST with highlighted edges and total cost

## Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Canvas API for graph rendering
- LocalStorage for theme persistence
- Font Awesome for icons
- Google Fonts (Inter) for typography
